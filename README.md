# Neighborhood Project

I created this project as part of Udacity Fullstack-development course. It shows different places in the neighborhood where I live currently. 

The user can check my favorite places and can filter based on the user input. The App also uses Google Maps API and Forsquare API to view markers and show the details of each restaurant.



## Prequisite : 

    * Google Map Account 
    * Forsquare Account

** Google Map Account **
    - Go to https://console.developers.google.com
    - From Library make sure that Google Maps JavaScript API is enabled.
    - Create Credentials and get your **API Key** ( will be used in index.html - Replace [YourGoogleAPIKEY] with it )


** Forsquare Account **
    - Go to https://developer.foursquare.com/
    - Create a new App
    - Get your **ClientID** and **ClientSecret** ( Will be used in -> JS/Controllers/ForSquareController.js )

Open index.html from your browser and enjoy the App!
